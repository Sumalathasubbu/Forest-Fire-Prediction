# Forest-Fire-Prediction

Forest fires is one of the important catastrophic events and have great impact on environment, infrastructure and human life. For the need of an early warning detection system of forest fires, there are various methods that have been used including : physics-based model, statistical model, machine learning model and deep learning model.


This article aims to conduct the hyperparameter tuning experiment for predicting the burned area of the forest fires specifically in the northeast region of Portugal, based on the spatial, temporal and weather variables where the fire is spotted using deep learning.

We use public dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires. This prediction can be used for calculating the forces sent to the incident and deciding the urgency of the situation. The method that we will use is the artificial neural network/ deep learning with the classification problem for predicting the forest fires.

A brief overview of artificial neural networks (ANN):
ANN are made of layers with an input and an output dimension. The latter is determined by the number of neurons (also called ‘nodes’), a computational unit that connects the weighted inputs through activation function (which helps the neuron to switch on/off). The weights, like in most of the machine learning algorithms, are randomly initialized and optimized during the training to minimize a loss function.
